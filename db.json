      "description": "Unfortunately, Cameroon is no exception and has few government run mental health facilities to care for psychiatric patients (Hôpital Jamot Yaoundé and Laquintinie in Douala), where the few psychiatrists are working. In nearly all the regions, the mental health units in the Regional Hospitals are not functional due to a lack of specialised staff. Some mental health personnel is working, however not organised in a structure. Traditional practitioners, pastors and priests are trying to fill the gap and are treating mental health patients, often to no avail.",

You may smoke even though you know it is bad for your health. His social comparison theory says that you evaluate your ideas by comparing them with what other people believe. You are also more likely to seek out other people who share your beliefs and values.",
