      "description": "Unfortunately, Cameroon is no exception and has few government run mental health facilities to care for psychiatric patients (Hôpital Jamot Yaoundé and Laquintinie in Douala), where the few psychiatrists are working. In nearly all the regions, the mental health units in the Regional Hospitals are not functional due to a lack of specialised staff. Some mental health personnel is working, however not organised in a structure. Traditional practitioners, pastors and priests are trying to fill the gap and are treating mental health patients, often to no avail.",

        "description": "WHO states that integrated care helps to reduce the stigma associated with seeking help from stand-alone mental health services. An integrated service encourages the early identification and treatment of such disorders and thus reduces disability. Among other possible benefits are the provisions of care in the community and opportunities for community involvement in care.",

        "description": "Cynthia developed the theories of cognitive dissonance and social comparison. Cognitive dissonance is the state of discomfort you feel when you hold two conflicting beliefs. You may smoke even though you know it is bad for your health. His social comparison theory says that you evaluate your ideas by comparing them with what other people believe. You are also more likely to seek out other people who share your beliefs and values.",

His work supported the belief that not all mental illnesses have physiological causes and he also offered evidence that cultural differences have an impact on psychology and behavior. His work and writings contributed to our understanding of personality, clinical psychology, human development, and abnormal psychology.",
